DACLIPS
========

A much better C++ code set to pick up and work with. 

While I abhor lang ghettos, C++ i the modern lang of
choice for to the metal efficiency and this code
set has many characteristics I wish to continue
and it's also much further along than the grudge
project (CacheManager).

Basically it's a low level Data Acquistion system
married to CLIPS. Some wide swathes of it are
tested and worked out functionality but ATM
it's still just a sketch, albeit a huge one
with a lot of proven code in embedded packages
such as boost, xmlrpc/c, and of course CLIPS.

Largely static at this commit.
